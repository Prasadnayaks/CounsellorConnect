## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
* **Backend (Core):** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
* **Backend (AI Chatbot):** Python (FastAPI, Uvicorn) with Google Generative AI (Gemini) via WebSockets
* **State Management (Flutter):** Provider (primarily for theming, `setState` for local screen state)
* **Key Flutter Packages:** `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`, `image_picker`, `intl`, `speech_to_text`, `flutter_local_notifications`, `provider`, `lottie`, `cached_network_image`, `web_socket_channel`, `table_calendar`, `flutter_slidable`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is a standard Flutter application.

**Prerequisites:**

* Flutter SDK (ensure `flutter doctor` reports no issues)
* For iOS: macOS with Xcode and CocoaPods
* For Android: Android Studio/SDK
* Firebase project setup (with `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS configured in the respective platform folders).
* Python environment for the FastAPI backend.

**Running the Flutter App:**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd counsellorconnect`
3.  Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4.  Run the app: `flutter run`

**Running the FastAPI Chatbot Server (Python):**

1.  Navigate to the `careconnect_server` directory.
2.  Create a `.env` file in `careconnect_server/` with your `GEMINI_API_KEY`:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file in `careconnect_server/` based on your Python backend's dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `pydantic`, `pydantic-settings`, `python-dotenv`, `google-generativeai`, `websockets`)*
5.  Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
6.  **Important:** Update the `_webSocketUrl` in `lib/self_care/screens/general_chatbot_screen.dart` to point to your server's IP address if testing on a physical device or an emulator that isn't using `localhost` (e.g., `ws://YOUR_COMPUTER_LOCAL_IP:8000/ws/v1/careconnect_chat`).

## üìù Future Enhancements (Examples)

* Video call integration for appointments.
* Group therapy session capabilities.
* Advanced analytics for users and counselors.
* More sophisticated AI chatbot features (e.g., RAG, tool use).
